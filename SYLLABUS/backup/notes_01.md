<h4>TARGET AUDIENCE:</h4>
<b>Who is the course for?</b>
<p>This course is designed for the aspiring data analyst, or anyone else who is interested in data science or learning SQL in a general sense.</p>
<b>What are the requirment?</b>
<p>Everyone is welcome. This is an introductory course, so no previous knowledge of SQL or databases is required.</p>

<h4>COURSE OVERVIEW:</h4> 

<p>The course will, informally, be split into two halves.
