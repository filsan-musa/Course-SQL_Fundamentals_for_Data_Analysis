</h1>Week 2: What is SQL?</h1>

<b>DATABASE:</b>  A database is a compilation of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, modification, and management. Databases can store various types of data, including text, and numbers. Typically, databases contain either structured or unstructured data.
<b>STRUCTURED:</b> Structured data refers to data that is organized in a pre-defined format, such as tables with rows and columns. Each piece of data is typically labeled and stored in a specific location within the database.
<li>Example: SQL</li>
<b>UNSTRUCTURED:</b> Unstructured data refers to data that does not have a pre-defined data model or structure. This type of data can include text documents, images, videos, and other multimedia files. Unstructured data is typically more difficult to analyze and process compared to structured data.
<li>Example: NoSQL</li>

<b>RDBMS:</b> A relational database management system is a software system that enables users to create, manage, and interact with relational databases. Relational databases organize data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. RDBMSs use structured query language (SQL) to perform various operations on the data, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

<b>SQL:</b> Short for Structured query language, is programming language used to query and manipulate relational databases. It provides a standardized way to perform tasks such as querying data, modifying database schema, and managing database security.

<b>SQL FLAVOUR:</b> SQL flavor refers to the specific implementation or variant of SQL supported by a particular database management system. Different database vendors may offer their own variations of SQL, which may include additional features or syntax extensions beyond the standard SQL specifications defined by organizations like the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Examples of SQL flavors include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite, among others. Each of these databases may have its own unique set of SQL features and syntax.
