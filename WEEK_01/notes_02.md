<h2>Week 2: What is SQL?</h2>

<p><b>WHAT IS A DATABASE?</b></p>
<p>A database is a compilation of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, modification, and management. Typically, databases contain either structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data. For instance, databases can store various types of data, such as text, numbers, images and even videos and audio files. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>STRUCTURED:</b> Structured data refers to data that is organized in a pre-defined format, such as tables with rows and columns. Each piece of data is typically labeled and stored in a specific location within the database.</li>
<ul><li>Example: SQL, Spreadsheets (ie. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets).</li></ul>
<li><b>SEMI-STRUCTURED:</b> Semi-structured data refers to data that does not conform to a rigid structure like tables but still contains some organizational properties, such as tags or markers, to separate elements. This type of data is more flexible than structured data but easier to analyze than unstructured data. </li>
<ul><li>Example: JSON, XML, email files, log files.</li></ul>
<li><b>UNSTRUCTURED:</b> Unstructured data refers to data that does not have a pre-defined data structure. This type of data can include text documents, images, videos, and other multimedia files. Unstructured data is typically more difficult to analyze and process compared to structured data.</li>
<ul><li>Example: NoSQL, Text Documents, PDFs, audio files.</li></ul>
</ul>

<p><b> DATABASES vs. DATASETS <p></p>

So far, we’ve established that a database is essentially a collection of data, which can be either structured, unstructured, or semi-structured. But how does a database differ from a dataset? Many of you have likely encountered datasets before—whether in a high school science or statistics class, a university course, or even in your professional work. To put it simply, a database is a system or mechanism designed for storing and managing data, while a dataset is a specific collection of related data points, often gathered from the same source or context.
<ul>
<li>A database stores raw data in an organized manner.</li>
<li>A dataset is created by selecting, filtering, or processing data from a database (or other sources) for a specific use case.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>RDBMS:</b> A relational database management system is a software system that enables users to create, manage, and interact with relational databases. Relational databases organize data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. RDBMSs use structured query language (SQL) to perform various operations on the data, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.</p>

<b>SQL:</b> Short for Structured query language, is programming language used to query and manipulate relational databases. It provides a standardized way to perform tasks such as querying data, modifying database schema, and managing database security.

<p><b>SQL FLAVOUR:</b> An SQL flavour refers to a variant of SQL supported by a particular database management system (RDBMS). Different database vendors may offer their own variations of SQL, which may include additional features or syntax extensions on top of core SQL functions and features as defined by organizations like the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
<ul><li>Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, Snowflake SQL, IBM DB2 etc.</li></ul>

**Note: For this course we will be working with the sqlite flavour of sql.
