<h2>Week 2: What is SQL?</h2>

<p><b>DATABASE:</b> A database is a compilation of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, modification, and management. Typically, databases contain either structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data. For instance, databases can store various types of data, such as text, numbers, images and even videos and audio files. </p>
<ul>
.</li>
<li><b>STRUCTURED:</b> Structured data refers to data that is organized in a pre-defined format, such as tables with rows and columns. Each piece of data is typically labeled and stored in a specific location within the database.</li>
<ul><li>Example: SQL, Spreadsheets etc.</li></ul>
<li><b>UNSTRUCTURED:</b> Unstructured data refers to data that does not have a pre-defined data structure. This type of data can include text documents, images, videos, and other multimedia files. Unstructured data is typically more difficult to analyze and process compared to structured data.</li>
<ul><li>Example: NoSQL, Text Documents, PDFs etc.</li></ul>
</ul>

**Note: So far we've noted that a database is essentially a collect of data which can be either structured, unstructured or semi-structured. But how do then databases differ from datasets?

<p><b> DATABASES VS. DATASETS <p></p>

Many of you have encountered datasets before, whether in a science class back in high school, during 


<p><b>RDBMS:</b> A relational database management system is a software system that enables users to create, manage, and interact with relational databases. Relational databases organize data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. RDBMSs use structured query language (SQL) to perform various operations on the data, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.</p>

<b>SQL:</b> Short for Structured query language, is programming language used to query and manipulate relational databases. It provides a standardized way to perform tasks such as querying data, modifying database schema, and managing database security.

<p><b>SQL FLAVOUR:</b> An SQL flavour refers to a variant of SQL supported by a particular database management system (RDBMS). Different database vendors may offer their own variations of SQL, which may include additional features or syntax extensions on top of core SQL functions and features as defined by organizations like the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
<ul><li>Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, Snowflake SQL, IBM DB2 etc.</li></ul>

**Note: For this course we will be working with the sqlite flavour of sql.
